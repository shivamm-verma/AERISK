- Contact the project lead for clarification on your assignment
- Do not modify code outside your assigned scope

## Development Areas

### ML Model Development
- Model training for component fault prediction
- Model optimization and evaluation
- Risk analysis algorithm development
- Documentation of model architecture and performance metrics

### Application Development

**Server-Side**
- API endpoints for data upload and processing
- Model integration and prediction pipeline
- Data validation and preprocessing
- Report generation logic

**Client-Side**
- User interface for data upload
- Model selection dropdown (for multiple models)
- Results visualization and risk analysis dashboard
- Report export functionality

## Code Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 for Python, ESLint for JavaScript
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Add comments for complex logic, especially in prediction algorithms
- Test your code thoroughly before submitting
- Ensure compatibility with AAI data formats

## Pull Request Process

1. Verify your assigned task is complete
2. Run all tests locally
3. Update relevant documentation
4. Submit PR with clear description of changes
5. Link any related task assignments
6. Address review feedback promptly

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter problems with your assigned work:
- Provide a clear description of the issue
- Include steps to reproduce
- Specify environment details (OS, Python version, dependencies)
- Note expected vs actual behavior
